hey there, I want you to create an application which is kind of an screensaver kind of app which runs on browser. The application displays relevant and useful information based on the time of the day and whether it is weekday or weekend,working day or holiday or work from day or going to office day. Information like good morning messages, quote of the day, traffic info, gps location of my bus i use to commute etc. But these features must be fully customizable and can be set by user just like we do in Alexa routines or iPhone shortcuts app. I'm good with Java and spring ecosystem for backend. You can use Vaadin flow for frontend. 
This must be a single user application.
