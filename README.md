## Recent Fixes (Latest Update)

### ‚úÖ Location Detection Completely Rewritten
- **Problem**: Location detection was broken and relied on complex JavaScript
- **Solution**: Moved location logic to Java backend with proper initialization
- **Result**: Location detection now works reliably with IP-based fallback

### ‚úÖ Backend Location Service
- **Problem**: Location detection was unreliable and complex
- **Solution**: Created robust LocationService with automatic IP-based initialization
- **Result**: Application always has location data available on startup

### ‚úÖ Simplified Location Management
- **Problem**: Complex JavaScript location handling with caching issues
- **Solution**: Simplified LocationManager component with backend integration
- **Result**: Clean, reliable location detection with proper error handling

### ‚úÖ SSL Certificate Issues Resolved
- **Problem**: Quotable API had expired SSL certificate causing connection failures
- **Solution**: Implemented multiple quote API fallbacks (quotable.io, zenquotes.io, quotes.rest)
- **Result**: Quote service now works reliably with automatic failover

### ‚úÖ Error Handling Enhanced
- **Problem**: SSL errors caused application crashes
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive error handling and logging
- **Result**: Application gracefully handles API failures and continues working

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Java 17 or higher
- Gradle 7.0 or higher

### Quick Start
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash

   ```bash
   ./gradlew bootRun
   ```

3. **Access the application**
   - Open browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`
   - The screensaver will display with default settings
   - Test location service at `http://localhost:8080/test-location.html`

### Configuration
The application uses sensible defaults but can be customized via `application.properties`:

```properties
# External API URLs (optional - defaults provided)
app.external.weather.api-url=https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast
app.external.location.api-url=https://ipapi.co/json/
app.external.quote.api-url=https://api.quotable.io/random
```

## Usage

### Initial Setup
1. **Access Settings**: Click the settings button (‚öôÔ∏è) in the top-right corner
2. **Set Display Name**: Enter your preferred display name for personalized greetings
3. **Configure Routines**: Add custom routines for different times of the day
4. **Enable Location**: Click the location button (üìç) to enable browser location for accurate weather data

### Features Overview
- **Personalized Greetings**: Shows "Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening, [Your Name]!"
- **Dynamic Backgrounds**: Changes based on time of day
- **Weather Information**: Real-time weather for your location
- **Quote of the Day**: Inspirational quotes that change daily
- **Traffic Updates**: Time-based traffic information
- **Location Detection**: Automatic location detection with manual override

### Location Services
- **Automatic Initialization**: Application starts with IP-based location
- **Browser Location**: Click location button to get precise coordinates
- **Reverse Geocoding**: Coordinates automatically converted to city names
- **Fallback System**: Always has location data available

## Technical Details

### External APIs Used
1. **Open-Meteo** (Weather & Geocoding): Free, reliable weather and location services
2. **IP-API** (Location): IP-based location detection
3. **Multiple Quote APIs**: Automatic fallback between different quote services
4. **Custom Backgrounds**: Local time-based background images

### Error Handling
- **SSL Certificate Issues**: Automatic fallback to alternative APIs
- **Network Failures**: Graceful degradation with mock data
- **Location Permission Denied**: Falls back to IP-based location
- **API Rate Limits**: Implemented caching to reduce API calls

### Performance Optimizations
- **Backend Location Management**: Server-side location handling
- **API Response Caching**: Reduces external API calls
- **Lazy Loading**: Content loaded on demand
- **Efficient UI Updates**: Minimal DOM manipulation

## Testing

### Location Service Testing
Access the test page at `http://localhost:8080/test-location.html` to:
- Test location service functionality
- Verify IP-based location detection
- Test browser location setting
- Check location status and data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Location Not Working**
   - Application automatically initializes with IP-based location
   - Click location button for precise browser location
   - Check test page for detailed location status

2. **Weather Data Unavailable**
   - Check internet connection
   - Weather service may be temporarily unavailable
   - Application will show mock weather data

3. **Quote Not Loading**
   - Multiple quote APIs are tried automatically
   - If all fail, a default quote is shown
   - Check application logs for specific errors

4. **SSL Certificate Errors**
   - Fixed in latest version with multiple API fallbacks
   - Application automatically tries alternative APIs
   - No user action required

### Logs
Application logs provide detailed information about:
- API calls and responses
- Location detection status
